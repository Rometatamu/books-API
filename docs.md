Project Idea: Book Collection Management System
1. Problem Formulation and Solution
Problem:
Many book lovers have trouble keeping track of their collections, what they've read, what they want to read, and sharing recommendations with friends. Keeping physical books or even electronic lists isn't an effective solution as it can be difficult to manage and track information about books.

Solution:
Create a web application that allows users to easily manage their book collection. Users can add, edit, delete, and view books. They can also mark books as read or want to read, and share recommendations with friends.
